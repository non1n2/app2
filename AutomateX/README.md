# My Project Name Automate

This repository contains the source code for the AutomateX project, which is composed of a Laravel API backend and a Flutter cross-platform frontend.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into two primary folders:

- `/backend-laravel`: Contains all the PHP source code for the Laravel backend API.
- `/frontend-flutter`: Contains all the Dart source code for the Flutter mobile application.

Each directory contains its own `README.md` file with specific instructions for that part of the project.
